An MLB points fantasy player scoring calculator
Uses: Multiple inheritance, OOP, vectors, tons of parsing
 
The goal is to be able to calculate the number of fantasy points for hitters
and for pitchers, no matter what the categories of a league and no matter what 
the league's scoring settings are. 

This app relies heavily on user input, which allows for great customizability,
but creates a slightly annoying interface.
